## Day 24: Crossed Wires

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24

Completed-(ish) in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) using [glacier](https://hexdocs.pm/glacier/) for testing.

I say '-ish' because in part 2, I didn't get the code to the point of automatically identifying the solution.  But it was able to narrow it down to the point where the correct answer could most easily be found by manual inspection of the outcome.

To start, run `devenv up` in this folder.
