## ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

https://adventofcode.com/2024

Planning to do each day in a different language:

Setup build environment by [Installing Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) and then running `nix-shell` in the root of the repo.  This should ensure all build tools and dependencies are available.  Then, within the Day folder, language/framework specific methods are used to install/run each program.

Typically, the Advent of Code sample & test data and answers are contained in ignored files typically (naming may vary between days depending on circumstances and variability between parts) named:

* Samples:
  * `sampledata.txt`
  * `sampledata.answer.txt`
  * `sampledata.answer2.txt`
* Test:
  * `testdata.txt`
  * `testdata.answer.txt`
  * `testdata.answer2.txt`

It's up to each language's test runner to load the data and pass to the test suite.
