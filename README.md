## ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

https://adventofcode.com/2024

Planning to do each day in a different language:

Setup dev environment by [Installing devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/#installation) (involves installing [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/)) and then running `devenv up` in each `Day` folder.  This will:

1. ensure all build tools and dependencies for that day are available
2. launch any test watchers
3. launch preferred editor for that language

Typically, the Advent of Code sample & test data and answers are contained in ignored files typically (naming may vary between days depending on circumstances and variability between parts) named:

* Samples:
  * `sampledata.txt`
  * `sampledata.answer.txt`
  * `sampledata.answer2.txt`
* Test:
  * `testdata.txt`
  * `testdata.answer.txt`
  * `testdata.answer2.txt`

It's up to each language's test runner to load the data and pass to the test suite.
