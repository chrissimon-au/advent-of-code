## Day 3: Mull It Over

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3

Completed in [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/).

Uses [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) and [shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) to create a test loop around the Rockstar interpreter.

Run `test.sh` in `/Day03/` to start a hot reload test loop.
