https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/19

Complared Part 1 in [Picat](https://picat-lang.org/).

Due to challenges working out how to manage the Picat state space in the planner, moved to [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for Part 2, in the [csharp subfolder](./csharp/Day19.cs).

To start, run `devenv up` in this folder.
